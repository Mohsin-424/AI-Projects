🔐 Exploring QR Code Authentication with OpenCV and Python! 🔐

I'm excited to share a recent project where I implemented a QR code authentication system using Python, OpenCV, and Pyzbar. This system leverages QR code technology to enhance security by granting or denying access based on a whitelist of authorized users.

Here's a quick overview of how it works:

📸 The webcam captures real-time video.
🔍 The system decodes QR codes in the video feed.
✅ If the decoded data matches an entry in the whitelist, access is granted.
❌ If not, access is denied.
📏 Visual feedback is provided directly on the video feed, making the system user-friendly and intuitive.

This project demonstrates the potential of integrating computer vision and machine learning to create practical, real-world applications. I'm thrilled to continue exploring the possibilities of AI and IoT to solve everyday challenges.
